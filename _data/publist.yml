- title: "An Efficient Deep Learning Method for Detection of COVID-19 Infection Using Chest X-ray Images"
  image: paper2_image.png
  description: In this paper, a lightweight CNN model called LW-CORONet is proposed that comprises a sequence of convolution, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and pooling layers followed by two fully connected layers. The proposed model facilitates extracting meaningful features from the chest X-ray (CXR) images with only five learnable layers.

  image: paper6_image.png
  description: we propose an extremely lightweight CNN with multi-scale feature learning blocks called as MFL-Net. The MFL-Net comprises a sequence of MFL blocks that combines multiple convolutional layers with 3×3 filters and residual connections effectively, thereby extracting multi-scale features at different levels and preserving them throughout the block.

  description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.
