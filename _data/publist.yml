  description: In this paper, a lightweight CNN model called LW-CORONet is proposed that comprises a sequence of convolution, rectified linear unit (ReLU), and pooling layers followed by two fully connected layers. The proposed model facilitates extracting meaningful features from the chest X-ray (CXR) images with only five learnable layers.

  description: Why is there so much variation in TBG devices? And are open devices more disordered than encapsulated ones? We introduce a new method to continuously map inhomogeneities of a moiré lattice and apply it to open-device TBG to show that twist angle variation is small over areas of hundreds of nm.

  description: We directly test the consistency of results from these three techniques by comparing data from the correlated metal Sr2RhO4. Using ARPES, STM, and quantum oscillations, we find good agreement for the Fermi surface topography and carrier effective masses. Hence, the apparent absence of such an agreement in other quantum materials, including the cuprates, suggests that the electronic states in these materials are of different, non-Fermi liquid-like nature.
